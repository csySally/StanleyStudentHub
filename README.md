## Google Calendar Integration Setup

### Get Calendar ID

1. Create a dedicated Google Calendar
   • Go to Google Calendar
   • On the left panel, click the "+" next to “Other calendars” → Create new calendar
   • Name it something like Stanley Events Calendar
   • Save it
   • Create events under this calendar

2. Make the calendar public
   • Go to the calendar’s Settings
   • Under “Access permissions for events” → Check Make available to public
   • Copy the Calendar ID under “Integrate calendar”
   • Format looks like: c_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@group.calendar.google.com

### Why this is not set up using a Stanley College staff account

Due to admin-level restrictions on our Stanley Google Workspace:
• Calendar access and sharing options are limited;
• Staff-created calendars cannot be made publicly visible to everyone (outside the organization).

To allow public access (so the events can be seen by external visitors without logging in), I used a personal Google account to create and share the calendar.

Once Stanley’s admin permissions are updated, this integration can be migrated to an official calendar account.
